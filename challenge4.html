  <h1>My Perfect Trip to Italy</h1>
  <p>Italy is home to some of the world's best food, wine, and art. Add in gorgeous coastlines, beautiful beaches, world-class fashion, phenomenal hiking trails, villas in Tuscany, and gelato, and you have the ingredients for an epic vacation. Italy is a favorite destination for many travelers for a very good reason. Come live "la dolce vita," the sweet life. That is why I chose Italy as my perfect trip to go to.</p>

  <h2>The Animals I would love to see</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Italian wolf</li>
    <p>The Italian wolf (Canis lupus italicus or Canis lupus lupus), also known as the Apennine wolf, is a subspecies of the grey wolf native to the Italian Peninsula. It inhabits the Apennine Mountains and the Western Alps, though it is undergoing expansion towards the north and east. As of 2022 the wolf population within Italy is estimated to be 3,307 individuals. Although not universally recognised as a distinct subspecies, it nonetheless possesses a unique mtDNA haplotype and a distinct skull morphology.</p>

    <li>Whales</li>

    <p>Off the island of Elba live many marine mammals and cetaceans, such as dolphins, fin whales, and sperm whales. The Tyrrhenian Sea is in fact known as the International Cetacean Sanctuary. During excursions in the Tyrrhenian Sea, it’s possible to meet other marine animals: turtles, Spinetail devil ray, swordfish, sunfish, seabirds, pilot whales, grampuses, zephyrs, stenellas, and bottlenose dolphins. Established in 2001 in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea, the International Cetacean Sanctuary covers a marine area of 96,000 hectares in the triangle between the tip of Hyères (France), Punta Falcone and Capo Ferro (Sardinia), and Fosso Chiarone (Tuscany). The best time to spot whales is from late April to early October. </p>

    <li>Flamingos</li>
    <p>Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia, is the only place in Italy where flamingos nest in a stable way and can be seen mainly near the pond of Molentargius and that of Santa Gilla. The best period is the first weeks of June when these beautiful animals stop to nest. In autumn in some parks arrive populations of common and coral gulls and pink flamingos that stopover before continuing to the reproduction areas in Tunisia. Flamingos can be easily sighted also in the Salina dei Monaci of Torre Colimena (Puglia), in the reserve “Oasi Faunistica di Vendicari” (Sicily), in the natural Oasis of Pantano di Saline Joniche (Calabria), Lago Patria (Campania), in the nature reserves of “Diaccia Botrona” and “Padule Orti-Bottagone” (Tuscany), “Saline di Tarquinia” (Lazio), in the Po Delta Park and Comacchio Valleys (Emilia Romagna), in the Palude della Rosa of Torcello Island (Veneto) and in Villa Invernizzi in Milan (Lombardy).</p>
