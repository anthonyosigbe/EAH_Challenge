  <h1>You Can Learn Anything</h1>

  <p>No body started smart we all start zero. Can't talk, can't walk certainly can't do algebra. Adding, Reading, Writing, riding a bike <em>nobody is good at anything at first.</em> There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn't count to 10 and <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us. Thankfully, we are born to learn Slowly, surely, you stumble, slip, crawl, fal , and fail, and fall, frustrating, confusing, trying, struggling, until one day, you walk One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next. <strong>Each wrong answer making your brian a little bit stronger.</strong> Failing is just another word for growing and you keep going. This is learning. Knowing that you'll get it even if you haven't gotten it yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe are built on basic ideas that anyone can understand. Whoever you are, wherever you are, you only have to know one thing <strong> <em>you can learn anything.</em></strong>
